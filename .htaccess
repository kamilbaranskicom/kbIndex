# [kbIndex]
# copy/move this file to the DocumentRoot of your website
#

# 1. Disable default listing
Options -Indexes +FollowSymLinks

# 2. Tell Apache what to do when no index file is found
# This is much more reliable than mod_rewrite for directory indexing
DirectoryIndex index.php index.html /kbIndex/index.php

# 3. Handle cases where a file/folder is missing (optional but recommended)
FallbackResource /kbIndex/index.php
